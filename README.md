## Documentation

- **[Pipelines â†’](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws/pipelines)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Docker daemon must be installed and running. Please see [Install Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for more information.

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-aws.git
cd flowpipe-mod-aws
```

### Credentials

By default, the following environment variables will be used to authenticate:

- `AWS_PROFILE`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_PROFILE`

You can also create `credential` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/aws.fpc
```

```hcl
credential "aws" "aws_profile" {
  profile = "my-profile"
}

credential "aws" "aws_access_key_pair" {
  access_key = "AKIA..."
  secret_key = "dP+C+J..."
}

credential "aws" "aws_session_token" {
  access_key = "AKIA..."
  secret_key = "dP+C+J..."
  session_token = "AQoDX..."
}
```

### Configuration

If you want to configure your default region and not need to enter it each pipeline run, you can set the `region` variable:

```sh
cp flowpipe.fpvars.example flowpipe.fpvars
vi flowpipe.fpvars
```

```hcl
region = "us-east-1"
```

When running a pipeline, you can override this default region with the `region` pipeline argument, e.g., `--arg region=ap-south-1`.

### Usage

List pipelines:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline list
```

Run a pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run describe_ec2_instances
```

You can pass in pipeline arguments as well:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run describe_ec2_instances --arg 'instance_ids=["i-1234567890abcdef0", "i-abcdef12345"]' --arg instance_type=t2.micro
```

To use a specific `credential`, specify the `cred` pipeline argument:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run describe_ec2_instances --arg cred=aws_profile --arg instance_type=t2.micro
```

For more examples on how you can run pipelines, please see [Run Pipelines](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/pipelines).
